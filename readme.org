These scripts allow you to iteract easily with jser files via command line. The general structure of a command is as follows:

=jser-cli/cli.py <subcommand> <jser filepath>=

Adding a symlink in a directory in your path pointing to this repo's ~cli.py~ means you can use the command across your system. For example:

=/dir/in/path/jser -> /path/to/jser-cli/cli.py=

Will allow you to to use the command =kh-cli= on your system.

** Examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
jser objects /path/to/my_series.jser     # prints a list of objects in the series
jser alignments /path/to/my_series.jser  # current alignment denoted by a *
jser groups /path/to/my_series.jser      # prints a list of groups
jser src_dir /path/to/my_series.jser       # print the src_dir (the image directory)
#+END_SRC
