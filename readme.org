These scripts allow you to iteract easily with jser files via command line. The general structure of a command is as follows:

=jser-cli/cli.py <subcommand> <jser filepath>=

Adding a symlink in a directory in your path pointing to this ~jser-cli/cli.py~ means you can use the command across your system (assuming the ~cli.py~ file is executable).

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
chmod u+x /path/to/jser-cli/cli.py                # make cli.py executable to user
ln -s /path/to/jser-cli/cli.py /dir/in/path/jser  # symlink from a folder in path variable
#+END_SRC

Will allow you to to use the command =jser= on your system.

** Examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
jser objects /path/to/my_series.jser       # prints a list of objects in the series
jser alignments /path/to/my_series.jser    # current alignment denoted by a *
jser groups /path/to/my_series.jser        # prints a list of groups
jser src_dir /path/to/my_series.jser       # print the src_dir (the series image directory)

# add obj_1, obj_2, and obj_3 to new_group
# store returned json object in new_series.jser
jser add-to-group /path/to/my_series.jser new_group obj_1 obj_2 obj_3 > new_series.jser
#+END_SRC
